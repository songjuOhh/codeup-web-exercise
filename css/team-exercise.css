===== GROUP 2 - Color Properties (Room 2)

0. Prepare code examples to present answers to the following questions: / Kailan

1. How does hexadecimal color coding work? / Aharown

- 	Hex color codesstart with a pound sign or hashtag (#) and are followed by six letters and/or numbers. The first two letters/numbers refer to red, the next two refer to green, and the last two refer to blue. The color values are defined in values between 00 and FF (instead of from 0 to 255 in RGB).



2. Why use CSS color names over hex values and vice versa? / Michael

	- HEX VALUES , give us an option to pick specific shades of a color. This gives us a wide variety of color options, this is also the more professional and preferred method.

	- It should be noted that specifying Colors By Name, is NOT the preferred method and is NOT something you will see used often.


3. Why use rgb to define a CSS color vs. a hex value?  /  Andre

-	The RGB is easier to use because its color scheme is a three-channel format containing the amount of Red, Green, and Blue.
	For example: RGB(255,0,0);} is Red.
	RGB(0,255,0) is green
	RGB(0,0,255) is blue.

-	It's also easier to add opacity to your color.For example : RGBA(255,0,0,0.3)  red with opacity  VS in hexadecimal, that is less intuitive .

4.What is the difference between 3 digit hex values and 6? / Aharown

- 	The CSS 3-digit hex color notation is shorthand for the 6-digit hex notation. Some six-digit hex colors can be written using a three-digit shorthand.Three-digit shorthand is where you combine the duplicate digits from each color component into one. This results in a three digit hex number instead of six.



5. 'background' and 'background-color' properties can produce the same output; why is this possible? /  Jason

-	In CSS: 'background' contains multiple options, background:blue is just shorthand for background-color:blue and do the same thing.






6. What is the 'a' in rgba? /  Aharown

- RGBA(Red-Green-Blue-Alpha)
The RGB color model is extended in this specification to include “alpha” to allow specification of the opacity of a color.




7.What is the 'Digital Color Meter' on a Mac? How is this helpful? / Songju

- 	an application that comes installed with every Mac. Its primary use is to locate a color on your screen and provide the values of that color. Those colors can be provided as three different values such as RGB, Hexadecimal, and as a percentage.

- useful for finding the hexadecimal value of a color for use with HTML and CSS but it’s also great for mastering UI design, understanding gradients and shadows, and if you find yourself needing to know the location of your mouse on screen it even can provide the coordinates for the location at any time.




BONUS (if time)

What are CSS gradients?  / Jason


-	In CSS: gradients are a background color with the attribute to apply multiple colors in different patterns. Linear, Radial and Conical.

background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color1, color2, color3, color4 etc.
