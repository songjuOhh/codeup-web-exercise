    1.  What is an array? Element? Index?

      arrays - []
        array variables where 'element' would be traced for index number

      element -
        data that is stored in an array

      Index - indexOf / lastIndexOf() / findIndexOf()
        represents the position of the element in the array.


    2.  How would you access the first element in an array?

      let array = [1,2,3,4,5];
      array.indexOf(0);
      // 1
      - because the first element: 1 is read as 0
      - since it will be read from 0... 0,1,2,3,4...

      or array[0];


    3.  What happens when you access an element at an index
        that has not been assigned a value?

      array.lastIndexOf(30);
      // -1 =

      it will return -1

    4.  What are the differences between a for loop and forEach loop?
        Why use one over the other?

      for loop =
        - original ways  of iterating over array
        - faster in performance
        - 'break' statement can be used
        - the parameters are
            = iterator
            = counter
            = incrementor
        - it works with the await keyword
        - PROS: variety of traversals
        - CONS: more complicated syntax
        - USE: when you need yo iterate

      forEach loop =
         - newer way w/ lesser code
         - slower
         - 'break' cannot be used because they have 'callback' function
         - the parameters are
            = iterator
            = index of item
            = array to iterate

         - await keyword cannot be used due to 'callback' function
           it may lead to incorrect output
